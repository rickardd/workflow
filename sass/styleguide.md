## Setup

This kss setup is tested with

- grunt-kss-node v.1.0.3
- node v.4.2.2
- npm v.2.14.7


## What is kss styleguide

It's a npm package that auto compiles a styleguide based on sass and css comments.



## Who is it for?

The style guide is created for both front- and back- end developers.



## I'm a backend developer

I promise to only copy and use styles that's documented here. If I don't find what I'm looking for here I will ask the frontend team. Also as an backend developer I promise to not hack this styleguide and/or inserting dirt.



## I'm a frontend developer

Yay. I'm free and can create anything. But with freedom comes responsibility. I promise to maintain the styleguide updated.

After installation I can ether runt

```
grunt styleguide
```

which will compile all sass comments into a up to date styleguide.

Or I can run

```
grunt watch
```

Which will constantly check for sass changes and auto compile the styleguide.
